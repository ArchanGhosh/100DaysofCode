# 100DaysofCode

This is the official Repo for my 100days of Code Challenge.

Fingers Cross and Wish me luck. mostly I'll Code in kaggle and put the links in log.txt to keep a progress.

The problems that were worked on:

Day 1 : [LoL Diamond Rank Classification Problem on kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/archanghosh/league-of-legends-diamond-rank-classification)

        Progress : Completed the entire note-book with data cleaning, feature engineering and different classification models

Day 2 : [Gender Classification Notebook Based on Tensorflow.](https://www.kaggle.com/archanghosh/voice-based-gender-classification-using-tensorflow)
        
        Progress : Completed the entire data visualization and modelbuilding with an Accuracy of over 98%

Day 3: Worked on Pet Adoption problem on Hacker-earth (Failed miserably)
        
        Progress: 10+ hours of work went to nothing, only 37% accuracy

Day 4: Worked on Super-Resolution Project and also made a [GAN training visualization](https://github.com/ArchanGhosh/GAN-/blob/master/GAN_Basics_in_Tf2_0.ipynb)
       [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/archanghosh/gan-basics-in-tf2-0)
                                                          
        Progress: Completed a whole notebook for some Basic Introduction to GAN
        
Day 5: Made a DC-GAN model for MNIST digit Creation. Both on Colab and Kaggle.

        Progress: Completed entire model with visualization.

Day 6: DC-GAN for Fashion MNIST. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/archanghosh/dcgan-on-fashion-mnist-in-tf2-0) [Github](https://github.com/ArchanGhosh/100DaysofCode/blob/master/DC_GAN_for_FASHION_MNIST.ipynb)
        
        Progress: Entire Notebook plus visualization and publishing.
        
Day 7: Worked on PyTorch Begineer level NN

        Progess: 
        
Day 8: Sat in Goldman Sachs Hiring examination, didn't get extra time.



Day 9: Working on coursera Specialization
